        <p class="text" id="wrkxp">Working at a leading venue alongside their IT team has been an amazing experience that has given me an insight into how businesses IT teams work 
            across the venue to support one another. Throughout my time at this arena I have been tasked with creating designs for some of the upcoming projects that are in development.
            To ensure these designs meet the criteria I have attended crucial meetings to discuss the design ideas for these new projects. This experience has gained me more confidence when 
            talking to a team of people about my ideas and taking note of any ideas the team have that would enhance the work that I have produced.</p><br>

                <p class="text">As part of the DV & UX module I completed whilst studying, we were tasked with the job to create a website to visualise two datasets against one another.</p>
                <p class="text">Through this work I learnt how to use js charts and have them update through event handlers rather than refreshing pages to change datasets</p>

                <p class="text">Working with a small group of my peers we created a slideshow tour to display artefacts to the public that were left behind the scenes</p>
                <p class="text">This was my first client project and through the project lifecycle I gained more confidence when talking to people about my ideas and what I had created</p>

                <p class="text">In this coursework the aim was to create/design a prototype that met the needs of a certain user. This meant finding out what the end user may require to navigate the software.</p> 
                <p class="text">In this module I achieved a 1st class grade showing how my prototype had taken the users needs into account.</p>

                <p class='text'>Through this project I created a website that allowed users in the local community to add food to the website in order for those in need to request it.</p>
                <p class='text'>This project was created to work on all devices with media queries as responsiveness was imperative to get the maximum user base.</p>
